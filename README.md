# CS4375_CP_Portfolio
This is the repository for my portfolio projects for the course CS 4375 @ utdallas. 

## Overview

Here is a [link](https://github.com/pekkalacd/CS4375_CP_Portfolio/blob/main/Initial%20Project/CDP19005_Machine%20Learning%20(2).pdf) to the overview document prefacing different machine learning branches algorithms.

### C++ Data Exploration

The [link](https://github.com/pekkalacd/CS4375_CP_Portfolio/blob/main/C%2B%2B%20Data%20Exploration/C%2B%2B_Data_Exploration_doc.pdf) emulates a variety of functions: sum, mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation found in R using C++. The data is from a given csv "Boston.csv" which is in the same folder. In the data file, there are two columns labeled `rm` and `medv`, for both of these, the sum, mean, median, and range are found; and the covariance and correlation are calculated between both of them. 

### Linear Models

The [link](https://github.com/pekkalacd/CS4375_CP_Portfolio/tree/main/Linear%20Models) points to linear and logistic regression model implementations on two sets of data, doing exploratory data analysis, and reporting of the findings, along with visualizations. 

### ML Algorithms From Scratch

The [logistic regression](https://github.com/pekkalacd/CS4375_CP_Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch/logistic_reg.cpp) and [naive bayes](https://github.com/pekkalacd/CS4375_CP_Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch/naive_bayes.cpp) algorithms are implemented via c++, exploring how those models work from scratch. In addition, [summary](https://github.com/pekkalacd/CS4375_CP_Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch/ML_Algorithms_from_Scratch.pdf) document explores and reviews the turn out those algorithms with respect to the titanic dataset, as well as discussing generative classifiers versus
discriminative classifiers and reproducible research in machine learning. 

### Searching for Similarity

The [searching for similarity](https://github.com/pekkalacd/CS4375_CP_Portfolio/blob/main/Searching%20for%20Similarity/Searching_for_Similarity.pdf) summary is available at the previous link. The part I was responsible for - in a group of four - was the regression portion, for which the R notebook for that is [here](https://github.com/pekkalacd/CS4375_CP_Portfolio/blob/main/Searching%20for%20Similarity/part1.rmd).

### Kernel and ensemble

The [kernel and ensemble](https://github.com/pekkalacd/CS4375_CP_Portfolio/tree/main/Kernel%20and%20Ensemble) files explore support vector machines for regression (Notebook 1) and classification (Notebook 2), as well as Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost ensemble methods (Notebook 3). In addition, the [narrative document] summary generalizes the actions that were taken on this assignment while exploring more about the inner workings, strengths, and weaknesses of these algorithms.
