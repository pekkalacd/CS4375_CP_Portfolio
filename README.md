# CS4375_CP_Portfolio
This is the repository for my portfolio projects for the course CS 4375 @ utdallas. 

## Overview

Here is a [link](https://github.com/pekkalacd/CS4375_CP_Portfolio/blob/main/Initial%20Project/CDP19005_Machine%20Learning%20(2).pdf) to the overview document prefacing different machine learning branches algorithms.

### C++ Data Exploration

The [link](https://github.com/pekkalacd/CS4375_CP_Portfolio/blob/main/C%2B%2B%20Data%20Exploration/C%2B%2B_Data_Exploration_doc.pdf) emulates a variety of functions: sum, mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation found in R using C++. The data is from a given csv "Boston.csv" which is in the same folder. In the data file, there are two columns labeled `rm` and `medv`, for both of these, the sum, mean, median, and range are found; and the covariance and correlation are calculated between both of them.
